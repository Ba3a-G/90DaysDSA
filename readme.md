# #90DaysDSAChallenge
I will start doing DSA after my JEE exams are over and will update this repo with my progress.

I will also log important or interesting things here.

My schedule will be based on [this](https://whimsical.com/dsa-in-90-days-EmPkf5utoFGRMnRqJjM6YV) graph.

I have been ill for the last few days and couldn't study. Gotta pick up the pace and clear the backlog now.
